## Overview

The Typing Test Application is a Java-based console application that allows users to test their typing speed and accuracy. Users can log in, complete typing tests, and view their statistics over time. The application stores user data and test statistics in a SQL database, providing insights into performance trends.

## Features

- **Typing Test**: Measure typing speed and accuracy with random text lines.
- **Statistics Tracking**: Track words per minute, characters per minute, and typing accuracy.
- **User Authentication**: Log in to view personalized statistics.
- **Data Storage**: Stores test results in a SQL database.
- **CSV Export**: Export statistics to a CSV file for offline analysis.
