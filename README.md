# Typing Test Application

A console-based typing test application that provides statistics on your typing speed and accuracy. It uses a random
selection of text lines for the typing test and stores the results in a database for later retrieval and analysis.

## Overview

The Typing Test Application is a Java-based console application that allows users to test their typing speed and
accuracy. Users can log in, complete typing tests, and view their statistics over time. The application stores user data
and test statistics in a SQL database, providing insights into performance trends.

## Features

- **Typing Test**: Measure typing speed and accuracy with random text lines.
- **Statistics Tracking**: Track words per minute, characters per minute, and typing accuracy.
- **User Authentication**: Log in to view personalized statistics.
- **Data Storage**: Stores test results in a SQL database.
- **CSV Export**: Export statistics to a CSV file for online analysis.

## HSQL commands

* Create users table

```hsqldb
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS TestUsers
(
    id            INT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY (START WITH 1) PRIMARY KEY,
    login         VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    register_date DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE
);
```

`

* Create statistics table

```hsqldb
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS TestStatistics
(
    id              UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    total_chars     INT    NOT NULL,
    total_words     INT    NOT NULL,
    incorrect_chars INT    NOT NULL,
    time            BIGINT NOT NULL,
    char_minute     INT    NOT NULL
)
```

* Create session table

```hsqldb
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS TestSession
(
    id           INT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY (START WITH 1) PRIMARY KEY,
    login_id     INT  NOT NULL,
    statistic_id UUID NOT NULL,
    date         DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE,
    time         TIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIME,
    FOREIGN KEY (login_id) REFERENCES TestUsers (id),
    FOREIGN KEY (statistic_id) REFERENCES TestStatistics (id)
)
```

```hsqldb
SELECT U.LOGIN,
       AVG(ST.CHAR_MINUTE)                           as "chars/min",
       AVG(ST.CHAR_MINUTE) - AVG(ST.INCORRECT_CHARS) as "avg correct",
       S.time
FROM TESTSESSION S
         INNER JOIN TESTUSERS U on U.ID = S.LOGIN_ID
         INNER JOIN TESTSTATISTICS ST on ST.ID = S.STATISTIC_ID
WHERE U.LOGIN = 'username'
GROUP BY S.time, U.LOGIN; 
   ```
